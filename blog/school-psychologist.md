# <center> What happened to my school psychologist? </center>  

I visited my high school on the evening of September 11 2025, and I was not expecting to hear something kinda shocking.

When I was in high school (graduated class of 2024) I was in counseling with a psychologist for about 2 years. My parents got me into counseling because they were worried about me and my mental health. And, I struggle to get those feelings out. So I got into counseling, and it helped me out a lot. I stopped suffering from depression, and from the most wonderful professional I ever met, I can open myself up again. I appreciated my time talking to her to this day and forever. Now that I'm not in high school, I do go see her to talk sometimes here and there in my free time. Until today, my school had a back to school night. I went to go see all my teachers and staff. When I go to one of my favorite teachers and asked if she's still there, I was told that she moved schools.

They don't know what school, but when it came to me hearing that, It felt like something stabbed me. Literally. I wanted to cry, but I held it in. I was so sad to hear that she moved schools. I wanted to see her again recently, but I don't know where she is.

I just hope she's doing well and that I can find her again someday.
And if you're reading this, I hope you're doing well.
I'll never forget you, and I'll always appreciate you for what impact you had on my life.

I'll be good, I promise.
