<h3> John Cena </h3>

### *Written on December 12, 2025*

John Cena retiring from wrestling hits different. Growing up watching him, you could tell he was destined to be a superstar, the way he carried himself and overcame every challenge proved it. Looking back at the speech he gave on Kai Cenat’s stream, the knowledge he dropped and how humble he was made me realize how life is about staying grounded no matter how far you go. Success means nothing if you forget who you are and where you came from. 

Glad I got to witness his entire wrestling journey. 
Happy retirement, Champ.
