# <center> School </center>  

At this point in time, I am now in my second year of college at Cal State University. My major is still Computer Technology and will continue to be that way. However, I am planning to take a minor in Psychology, as now I have a profound interest in the topic. Why so? Well, it is because of my time in counseling with a psychologist at my high school. She played a key role in finding out about my autism and has helped me through my darkest times possible. And from there, I liked how psychology worked. I have not enrolled in it yet, but once I free up my GEs, I will take it on. It is another thing I want to add to my education besides computers. For how the second year is going, it is going well. The classes I have are good, but some days it can be slightly stressful. But slowly, I feel like it has been taking a toll I have not discovered yet. I do not know what it is, but something tells me I just want to get a job at this point. I mean, I do not have work experience, but whatever hires me will work out. I have thought about it and will soon be starting to work by next year. I want to work at a job that can help distract yourself from school and make yourself relax from the stuff you deal with. And with that, you can enjoy what you like doing as a job. And yes, all that stuff from school can really tire someone out. Some days I feel like I need a break, but I cannot miss my education if it is important. I did at one point think about taking a break from school for a semester or worse, just leaving school. It is because I have already done so much school in my life where I just want to do what I enjoy doing as a job. I mean at the end, it all pays off (I do believe that). But school at this point is taking some type of toll on me, whether it be mental or the overload of classwork. That is all I really got to say for school, but all in short, everything is going well, but something is slowly taking a toll on me from it.
