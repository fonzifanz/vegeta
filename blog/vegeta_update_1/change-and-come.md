# <center> What's going to change and come? </center>  

There’s going to be a good number of things that’ll change around me and arrive at me starting soon by the end of this year. However, this won’t affect how things are now, I just want to rest assured that part. But unfortunately, I will have to distance myself from my digital confines as I have been far too long online. It’s time that I find something that will get me somewhere in the future for my life, as I can’t just stay doing school. So, I will list out the things that will change in the future for me.  

There are two changes.  
1. I will have to spend less time online to focus on my future endeavors (this will somewhat affect my time on gaming) and this doesn't mean I'm going away  
2. My time on hanging out with others will somewhat be limited (this will likely go back to normal once everything is sorted out)  

And for what's coming?  
1. Start getting into the workforce
2. Learn how to drive
3. Start having my own responsibilities as I grow to an adult

Those that are listed will be coming in the future like I said by the end of the year. This won't affect the current time, however. It comes so sudden because given the current situation my family is facing, I will have to set aside time for those matters. Those are the things I will be doing soon as my time as a young adult will be up and I will have to be an actual adult at that point.
