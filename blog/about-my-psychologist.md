<h3> About My Psychologist </h3>

### *Written on January 8, 2026*

Last night i talked to one of my new friends of mine.. about my psychologist. 

He believes that i should keep her close to me, which is what I've been doing since the day we first met. Just talking about her, after I found out she moved schools without warning, i still get emotional over it. A grown man is crying and shit, but it's something real. 

So I'm going to share something I never shared before between me and her (psychologist)

To show my absolute appreciation to her after counseling, I got her the same hello kitty plush my sister gifted me for my birthday, went into her office one day for a regular session, and then opened up how I feel and how she changed me for the better.

She accepted my gift and asked me something I never really get asked.

"Can I hug you? It looks like you could really use one right now-" 
I just absolutely kinda dumped myself on her, and asked if we can stay like this for a minute.

If you don't know me, I am touch starved. Ever since my parents told me I would live on my own instead of living in their room, I started having a burden of someone not being next to me in bed. I would get scared, have insomnia, and other stuff. This explains why I listen to stuff like "girlfriend" or "mommy" audios. it's to help me (for as real as it poses to be) through it. and not having a lot of people in my circle plays a role too, but it isn't a problem or concern anymore.

Back to what I was saying about my psychologist. After that long hug, I opened up about my sleeping problems, why I think I have insomnia, I listen to this and that to put to sleep.

You want to know what I promised her to do?

When I feel that way (feel alone in bed, scared, the need to put on an audio), I shouldn't be ashamed or afraid to bring my hello kitty plush of mine close to my arms, hug it like a person, and think about her.

That's the most important thing I still do, to this day. And I love how amazing she is for what she does for people who are struggling. At one point after a month or 2 since that moment, I've been told she's going to use that experience from that day, as a defining moment for her career. 

That tells me I've given someone a memory they won't forget. Just hearing that made me feel special, and I felt inspired where I started taking psychology classes in college.

After all that, I really miss her. I really do. I don't know where she is now, but I will keep the promise of the hello kitty plush, to be good, and to never be ashamed to be who I am. 

I love my psychologist, Jimenez. 
One day. We can meet again.
