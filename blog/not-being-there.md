# <center> Not Being There </center>  

It's been revealed to me that 2 of my good friends who I have been with recently, have thought about ending themselves and I was really shocked to hear that. One was because they went through a rough breakup last month, lack of people in their life, and unmotivated. The other was because how everything hurts for them.  
Stuff like that just scares me man. If you were to know me more as a person, you would know that I care for others around me. And that's who I have always been, and it helps me grow.  

If I have to be honest and up front, I feel like whenever I hear stuff about this from friends of mine or anyone that's family, I feel that I kinda wasn't good being there. Because anyone can be quiet about that with their life and I get that, it's my respect to acknowledge that. But, you can't just let that feeling bottle up. Eventually, that'll make you spiral and lose touch with yourself. I always let everybody know around me that if anything, they can come to me. Really.  
But man, stuff like this is like the worst thing to see as a person who deeply cares for others.
