<h3> The fascination of Airports </h3>

### *Written on December 27, 2025*

airports are so fascinating. 

someone is saying goodbye to the only place they’ve ever felt comfortable, while someone else is finally going back home, waiting to taste their mother’s home cooked meal. someone is quietly pushing their tears away to make the goodbyes easier than they are, while someone else is overflowing with happy tears, hugging people they’ve only talked to through digital screens for far too long. someone is rushing to make it to the check in counter, while someone else walks as slowly as possible, not ready to let the trip end just yet. someone is excited to finally spend their hard earned money on a well deserved vacation, while someone else has arrived in a completely new country, chasing opportunities and a future they’re just beginning to build.
