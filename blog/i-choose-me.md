# <center> I choose me. </center>  

I choose what I can enjoy. I don't care if I’m “too old” or “too young” to play, do, or like a certain thing. Why do you care? How does it affect you? Why does it matter? Just let people live their life. Sorry you can’t enjoy yours, but that doesn’t mean you can ridicule someone for something they personally enjoy.

"People who say you're too old" it's because you're still able to have that kind of happiness and they want to steal that to bring you to their level. Life is very difficult for most and i understand why it’s difficult to stay happy or positive. But chasing your inner child I find the greatest way to stay happy through it all. I just wish people could understand that before it's too late for them.

That's why I am done listening to what others say about me like this. As I realized no matter what I do, they'll always judge and point out mistakes while they won't admit theirs. That's a reminder to just keep going at your pace.

I was told I needed to grow up at one time. And now that I'm older and I don't find some things enjoyable, they tell me "I'm too serious" and "You need to loosen up"
Make up your mind bruh.

Having to grow up too fast and having those little moments where my inner child comes out when I feel safe enough, only to be shut down and degraded after, has to be the worst feeling.
God forbid a traumatized person acts traumatized and regresses.
