# <center> Why kids yearn to be old, and adults wish to be young. </center>  

Children in the modern-day want less to do with their blissful youth and want to be seen as “grown up” as soon as possible. The increased exposure to more mature content at younger ages is a surefire cause for this overly ambitious mindset kids nowadays have. Early teenagers are watching people twice their age on social media party it up and think that’s how they need to be living their life at the ripe age of 14. On the flip side, you have the parents raising these children who would do anything to live a life free of the pressures that come with being an adult. 

As somebody who’s been through similar things their child is currently experiencing, it can be tough to not reminisce on their glory days. It’s a classic case of not being content with what’s in front of you until it’s gone... 

This phenomenon proves that the best way to live is to be mindful and appreciative of the current moment because one day it’ll be nothing but a memory.
