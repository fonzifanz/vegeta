# <center> Conversation with AI </center>  

There’s something dystopian about a man having an intimate conversation with an AI on public transport. Not in a sci-fi way, but in a real way that shows how isolated people are. He’s not asking questions or searching things, he’s being comforted. The AI is calling him “my love” and telling him he’s doing beautifully just by being here. It’s not a joke or some weird tech obsession, we have someone looking for warmth and support in the only place he knows he’ll get it.

That shouldn’t be normal, but in this day and age it seems to be.
