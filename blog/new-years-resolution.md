# <center> New Years Resolution &#129330; </center>  

To me, I never understood the point of having new years resolutions, as I don't talk much about what I want to do and be great at for every year.  
It could be me living a private life or whatever, but when people ask me about it, I just be like "don't bother asking, just let me cook in peace."
