# <center> June is Men's Mental Health Month. </center>  

What does it mean? It means reaching out to your male-identifying friends and letting them know you’re here for them. Check up on one another and check up on yourself. Men’s mental health is often overlooked, and the ignorant stigma that mental health shows flaws that need to be broken. 

In recent years, mental health has become more involved, rightfully, in the discussion about health and wellness. Many recognize how to spot signs of poor mental health and suicidal ideation and what to do when encountering these traits, yet men’s mental health is still not talked about quite as much as the general promotion of mental well-being. Men are often overlooked when it comes to the conversation of promoting therapy and other resources to improve our well-being. 

As a man, I can admit that in our upbringing we’re often told to be the strong one in our platonic/romantic relationships, whether that be putting on a brave face or never acknowledging that most of us face depression at least once in our life. I’m here to tell you that being upset about something, getting diagnosed with a mental health issue, or reaching out for help does not make you any less masculine or less of a man. Because of this stigma, there are far more women that report their mental health issues in comparison to men, and this makes it seem that one gender deserves better mental health treatment than the other. There’s a lot of things that men deal with that are typically not backed up by the rest of society, and that’s something we need to change! 

The more we try to avoid talking about men’s mental health, the more men feel isolated and alone. Symptoms of depression and anxiety are already heavy enough, so feeling invalidated and less important than others will only worsen this. 

If you feel that your male friend (or anyone, really) may be experiencing suicidal ideation, the best way to know for sure is to directly ask.
