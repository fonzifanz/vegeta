<h3> Thank You, June of 2021 </h3>

### *Written on December 10, 2025*

I don't talk much about my past because I don't want to go back at it again. But I do remember that time; The time I thought about ending it all. Until a new person came into my life and gave me hope. I know they're not here with me anymore, (not dead, but not friends anymore) but I appreciate her a lot. I swear on my life, I wouldn't be here right now, without the person who picked me up from the floor and showed me the vision that I can keep going to get better. Although the friendship is long distance, it still made an impact. No matter what, I'll remember where I came from when I was at the bottom, contemplating everything. I wish we were still talking to each other, but as of last year she wanted to split ways. I won't say why for privacy reasons, but I understand. Ever since then, I'm now at a version of myself that is really who I am. And I am proud of it that I'm still here, with my family and new people around me. I'm still improving by discovering more of myself and how does my autism make me unique. 

I just want to say; Wherever you are right now, I hope you're doing well. I missed you a lot.

I'll be good, I promise.

Thank you.
