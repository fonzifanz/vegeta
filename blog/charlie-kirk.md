# <center> Rest in Peace to Charlie Kirk. </center>  

Charlie Kirk is a conservative activist, father and a husband. I don’t care if you politically disagree with him, but nothing justifies this sick act.

He was shot and killed at Utah Valley University, hosting an event for his conservative youth organization (Turning Point USA.) 

Political violence has no place in the United States. We all have our differences, but this is not the answer. No one should ever die because of a political opinion.

May God be with him, his wife, his kids, and his family. I really thought today was going to be an ordinary day before it happened, when I'm slightly feeling under the weather that i didn't put too much effort in school today.
