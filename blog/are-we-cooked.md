Whether you have been on TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, or anywhere on the internet in the last few years, you have certainly come across what can only be described as “Brainrot.”  

*Brain rot is a term used to describe internet content of low quality or value, or the negative effects (psychological, cognitive, etc.) caused by it. It implies the spending of excessive amounts of time spent online, with deterioration in cognitive functioning, attention span and intellect.*  

Chances are, you recognize this term and associate it with a random video or meme you saw in the last few hours. Phone addiction has become more prevalent in our society, making that “last few hours” scenario all too likely.  

While these videos or memes often give us a good laugh, it can feel dystopian when we step back and really look at what we are consuming daily. Terms like “Gyatt”, “Skibidi Toilet” and “Rizz” are all products of this “brainrot” trend and have quickly become part of everyday slang.  

Beyond these obvious examples, we are also rotting our brains in a more literal sense as we increasingly integrate social media into our daily lives. When people are confronted with the idea that social media is a negative influence, a common defense is, “but it’s educational content.” Often, though, this could not be further from the truth.  

A good analogy is our use of libraries. Most people in the Western world have access to libraries filled with vast amounts of information. However, if someone were to simply sit in a library and glance over each book without diving deep, they would not truly learn anything. The same logic applies to watching fifteen second “educational” content on TikTok and then simply swiping to the next video and repeating that process until your attention is needed elsewhere.  

Overall, it is hard to deny that these videos and this style of content can be genuinely fun at times. But it is crucial to acknowledge the reality: this content is metaphorically smoothing your brain as you endlessly scroll.
