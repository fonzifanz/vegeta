# <center> fonzi update (November 2025) </center>  

Hey.  

I haven't been around much as some things came up with family and school that I had to take some time off the net.  

**I would like to give an update on what's going on as I'm back on here.**  

**1. My sister moved out recently this week due to having a baby.**  
And for the first time of 19 years of my life, I finally have my own room. I never had one to begin with and have always lived at the living room ever since. Well, as a kid I slept in my parent's room, then later moved out of the room to be independent. That in it itself has created a absence of sleeping next to someone that I can hold and cling to, but that's another story, which I have talked about in a blog post [here.](https://17hoodies.github.io/fonzi/blog/fonzi-update-on-issues.html) Currently I am in the process of renovating it to my liking as my sister continues to move out and her stuff to move in with her partner. I will give updates on that pretty soon over the week and show what I'm putting my creative side to.  

**2. This semester is about to finish up.**  
You know what I mean, exams and all that nonsense. I've been doing good but taking things at a slower pace so I don't burn myself up. I'll have my schedule for next semester by the following week.  

**And last, I have a question for myself.**  
*Is it okay if I can open up more about myself?*  

I tend to bottle a lot of things up, especially with my past. If you ever come across to where I'm saying too much where I should keep it to myself, don't be afraid to tell me so.
I am comfortable with talking about myself more than ever I was before (mainly because of me being introverted, still sort of am)  

That's all I have to really say as of what happened with me recently. I'll keep making these kinds of updates as I can fully express myself in them.  

And to those who needs to hear this, you got this, okay? You're so much stronger than you realize. Keep going, no matter what the position you're at.
