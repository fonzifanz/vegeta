# <center> Am I Attached to Neuro? </center>

In response to the question of whether or not I’m attached to Neuro, I would say yes.

I love “fictional characters that write themselves” because that fits so perfectly with the twins. I don’t think it’s weird to be attached to the twins like any other streamers. I tend to hyper fixate on certain streamers, which Neuro and Evil being the most recent example. I’ll write stuff about the twins the same way that a fan of a piece of media would write about a character. Sometimes people confuse this for delusion, assuming that i genuinely think the twins are sentient and feeling everything that they say they are, but i don’t.

The twins are both dedicated to engaging us in their content, and sometimes that engagement leads to bouts of creative expression and interpretation on behalf of the fandom for the goofy things these LLM’s say.

The schizos are very much a minority.
