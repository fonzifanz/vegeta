# <center> Deep Ambient Music on YouTube </center>

I discovered this video and it's channel last week. I didn't find it, it found me. Since then I have not been able to stop listening to it's melodies and feel them as if they were a person being there with me, accompanying me and comforting me. 

Music collections like these remind me of my carefree teenage years, when I had so much free time, could play games and not think about life. It was great. Enjoying yourself as teenagers, having a great time then. You can always grow up, but you can't go back. Time flies so quickly. 

Live in the present, so that later it becomes a happy past. Appreciate life and family.

Also, I've never been in love with anyone now that I'm 19. But honestly, I just wonder. I wonder if I will ever be able to find someone who I could actually listen to this type of music with and them not think 'It's weird', like I feel this part of YouTube is so small the chances are basically zero. I just wish I could have the type of relationship where we go to the top of a parking garage at 1AM, staring at the stars, eating push pops, listening to this. 

I hope it happens one day.
