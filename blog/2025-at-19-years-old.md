# <center> 2025 as 19 years old </center>  

Man, you can say that 2024 was my year of the year recently. First of all, I want to thank God for giving me another blessed day to live in this game of life, and God is great. Secondly, my family and relatives for being there at my peak of happiness as big things did happen. And lastly, my friends and everyone else for allowing me to come into their network and really be the fonzi I am now. I could say that now I am better than I could ever be and I'm so proud of where I'm at now currently. This is considered where I learned a lot from other's help and from myself as I make discoveries on myself that help me identify who I really am and what makes me "me" in this world. And I can't thank the people enough for it who did so in hopes of seeing me at my best. 

What can I say really? Now that we're in 2025, why not this year be another year where I do great as now I'm entering another chapter at a clean slate. I'm still passionate and always have about what I love doing since I was a kid and now striving to make something off of it to let my creativity unleash. 2024 felt right, like if that time period was meant to tell me that I can really have anything the way I want it to be. And for those who sticked along besides me, thanks for being interested and giving me the audience to help express it. This may seem like I didn't say much, but really words can't describe everything that happened. But one thing you can really take out of this is that I am now at the point where I'm happy living at where I'm at now at this time of year. Again, thanks everyone for giving me a great year, and here's 2025 to another!
