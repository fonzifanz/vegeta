# <center> fonzi update on issues </center>  

There has been something I've been processing for a good minute about myself. Ever since I talked about this new profound "issues" with myself to my psychologist, I might have some sort of "Unmet Emotional Needs". It means the lack of fulfillment in areas such as connection, accomplishment, and contribution. This is what I see myself having for the past months or so. Also, another thing I seek is validation. I always have love and support throughout my life, but it's validation that I never really had. Validating someone means acknowledging and accepting their feelings, thoughts, experiences, and perspectives, even if you don't necessarily agree with them. It's about showing empathy and understanding, creating a safe space for them to express themselves without judgment. This is what I lack throughout my life.  Another thing is I might be "needy“. Never saw myself as needy, but I might be in some way that I seek neediness as "I need your presence". It may sound weird, but that's what I feel every time here and there. And for insomnia, it’s getting better currently as I strive to do better. So, I see myself having less insomnia now.
