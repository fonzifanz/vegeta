# <center> My High School Experience </center>  

I am currently a high school scholar who is about to graduate in the upcoming months. My experience in high school is an incredibly unique story and I will not forget it. At first before attending high school, I was afraid for the road ahead of me entering a new school and a new point in my life. But it turned out to be great and something to remember for my path to my plans after high school. Here is my experience in high school. 

Starting off with freshman year, the “new kid in town” but, there is a twist. It was the year 2020 and everyone was on lockdown because of a virus spreading worldwide. This made schools go virtual through Zoom (like FaceTime but for schools and businesses). With that, it did not give me motivation to succeed where I almost flunked that year. Luckily, I passed, and the school said that next year, all students will return to campuses with masks on. Overall, it made me trapped at home where I miss going to school with my friends and being with everyone like teachers and staff. 

As a sophomore, we are finally back on campus! This is where it was my first time going to the school I am going to be graduating from and once I stepped foot in, I saw the many opportunities this school is offering. My experience going to this new school went surprisingly good like no one gave me any problems or hassle. Plus, most of my friends have been there since as kids. I felt like I was in the right place where I could be myself at this school. I settled in and was dedicated to passing, producing big plans after high school. Overall, being a sophomore went great than I expected it to be. 

Becoming a junior made me feel pressured because of what was coming down the road. As a junior, the state and school board wants us to take tests to see if we are ready to become a successful adult like having a job and going to college/university once we graduate. Although I was worried what would happen if I failed, once I took the test, I got a decent score. With this, I was proud of myself knowing I was going to be successful right after high school. This got me into a university for 4 years majoring in Computer Technology. Overall, I did well above average as a Junior. At the end, it is going to pay off once I graduate. Now that I have my future life settled, my last year will go by in a blink of an eye. 

At the time of writing, I am now a senior after all those years. These are the last steps I take to become successful in my life. This is where the school year is mostly chill and has been relaxed, while having fun for one last time. But of course, you are going to have class, while most of mine were electives and the rest (2) was core classes. I currently have 2 months left until I graduate and up ahead is prom before that. I recently got the biggest achievement yet and that is I got accepted into university and receiving an academic scholar title (having a 3.5+ GPA for all 4 years). At this point, I wonder what the future waits for me at this point. 

So, my overall high school experience was not as difficult as I expected it, 4 years ago. I was able to do anything I wanted to do thanks to my family, friends, my wonderful teachers, and others who supported me along my journey. With this, I feel like I took an opportunity and completed the mission at the end. What I learned throughout high school is that life is based off decisions you make. It’s not about what you dealt; it’s about how you deal with it. In every situation, you must always keep your eyes and mind open because your decisions are what pave your destiny. Don’t let anyone get to you, what matters is what you want to achieve and making the right decisions.
