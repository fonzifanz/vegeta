# <center> Vibe Room is gone. </center>  

The other day, I was thinking about going back to Roblox games I used to play during the COVID pandemic. And there were a good amount of games that I played for a good amount of time. But there’s one that sticks out from the rest. A game that I have so much time in that it easily makes up as one of the few games I have a lot of time on, in my Roblox account. 

And what’s the game? It’s Vibe Room by raiiningdayss. I know what you’re getting ready to say, didn’t Roblox deemed all vibe games as a danger to child safety? Yes, and I get why so. But this specific vibe room, it wasn’t like that. I saw it as a social hangout with like-minded people where I can talk to. Keep in mind, during the pandemic I was suffering from depression and loneliness. And I saw this game as a way to cope and really get advice. I met some great people on there, which is something I won’t forget about. I was a regular and kind of a known person in the room. If I needed someone to talk to, this was the game. I appreciate this game when I think about Roblox and how much it holds to me. 

But now, it’s gone. As part of the ban wave on vibe games on Roblox. It’s like a piece of my Roblox history, gone. Even the other room by the same creator is gone too. This vibe room wasn't like the ones that were a danger to child safety. That vibe room was just a social hangout with people like me (from 3 years ago) where I can talk to others like a friend gathering. I remember meeting with the developer in-game one time when I was in a server all by myself. Really cool person, honestly. 

But hey, I guess this is one of the good things that came to the end. I don't blame Roblox for including this exact vibe game, I understand why they did it. But man, will I remember this game from now on. 

Rest in Peace to Vibe Room by raiiningdayss.
