<h3> I'm Starting My Anime Journey </h3>

### *Written on January 7, 2026*

I'm starting my anime journey today.

For those who don't know, I haven't watched anime ever since the first time I got recommended to watch Plastic Memories in 2022. That first anime I watched alone is the best I've seen. But from a few days ago as I browsed the animes based on romance, I have a good collection to eventually start watching anime. I'll show a list of what I have so far, and I'm welcome for recommendations based on romance because of plastic memories.

Also I recommend watching plastic memories if you're into romance, really good 1-season anime and honestly made me cry on the first episode.
