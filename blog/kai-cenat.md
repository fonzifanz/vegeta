Kai Cenat: *opens up about mental health*

People: You are rich. Your mental health is not an issue. Grow up.

Man: *commits suicide*

Same people: Mental health is important yall. Never forget.

Another man: I am struggling yall.

Same people: No. You aint. 


The cycle continues. I hate it when people don't take others seriously when opening up about their problems. People really need to take mental health more seriously. Etika and Reckful are MASSIVE examples of big creators who were going through hard times and had people not take it seriously.

Always remember.

It’s why I believe getting rich very young is one of the worst things that can happen to most men.

Not because money is bad. Not because success is bad. But because timing matters. A man’s 20s are usually when discipline, identity, purpose and resilience are formed. That only happens through pressure, responsibility, repetition and long periods of unglamorous effort.

If money arrives before those things are forged, it removes the very constraints that build them. The struggle isn’t about suffering for its own sake. It’s about earning authority over yourself. When wealth comes too early you skip prolonged responsibility, bypass years of delayed gratification, lose the daily friction that forces growth and you’re left with comfort before character.

So the man feels empty, unanchored and disconnected from normal life.

This is also why sons of wealthy men often underperform. Not because they’re lazy or stupid, but because they’ve never been required to become something. No real stakes. No earned competence. No consequences that force adaptation.

Purpose doesn’t come from pleasure or options. It comes from necessity and duty. What many fail to understand is that money doesn’t give a man meaning, it just reveals whether he already had it.

When a man’s internal development doesn’t match his external resources, psychological collapse is bound to happen. The dopamine wears off. The identity never formed. The “now what?” hits hard. The men who thrive with early success are the exception, and usually it’s because they still endured years of responsibility, discipline and consequence before the money showed up.

Abundance should come after the man is built, not before, otherwise wealth arrives faster than the psyche can integrate it.
