# <center> Tolerance </center>

The tolerance speech in a video about failure I watched recently has hit a cord with me. I've always thought holding that up as such a high virtue was a mistake.

"These people believe do things to young children as part of their belief system but we have to be tolerant?"
I am tolerant of quite a bit, but there are hard lines.

Also when people say "do whatever the crap you want"
You have no idea how many times I've heard that from someone who I've tolerated for way too long. I've been trying to tell that person that it's dangerous to tell that to anyone who suffers an addiction or mental illness. They labeled bad things as a good thing just because we live in a free country.
